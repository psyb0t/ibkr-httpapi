description: HTTP+JSON control plane over Interactive Brokers (ib_async + a local IB Gateway container) that the user already runs. Talk to a real brokerage with curl + JSON — market data (OHLC bars, snapshot/historical ticks, option chains + Greeks) across stocks/options/futures/cfd/forex/crypto, account/positions summaries, order placement / retrieval / cancellation, and server-side technical analysis via the wickworks sidecar. Bearer-token auth (API_TOKEN). Use when the user has deployed ibkr-httpapi and set IBKR_HTTPAPI_URL and wants to pull IBKR market data, inspect account/positions, run TA, or place/cancel orders. THIS API CAN PLACE, EXERCISE, AND CANCEL REAL ORDERS ON A REAL IBKR ACCOUNT — every account-mutating call requires explicit per-action user confirmation.

# ibkr-httpapi

HTTP client for an IBKR bridge the user has already deployed. It wraps
Interactive Brokers via [ib_async](https://github.com/ib-api-reloaded/ib_async)
and a Linux-native IB Gateway container, and exposes a curl-friendly JSON
surface: contract details, snapshot + historical ticks, OHLC bars, option
chains with Greeks, account/positions summaries, cross-asset order entry, and
server-side TA via the [wickworks](https://github.com/psyb0t/docker-wickworks)
sidecar. Same operational shape as its sister project
[mt5-httpapi](https://github.com/psyb0t/mt5-httpapi) — one bridge, one token,
same asset-class routing model.

This skill talks to a **running** ibkr-httpapi server. It does not stand one
up, does not provision IBKR credentials, and does not place trades on its own
initiative.

## Security & safety

**Destructive & irreversible.** `POST /orders` places a REAL order on a real
IBKR brokerage account — it moves real money and creates live market
activity with no undo. `DELETE /orders/{orderId}` and `DELETE /orders`
cancel real orders; `POST /options/exercise` exercises/lapses real option
contracts. An agent must NEVER call any of these unless the user explicitly
requested that exact action with the specific parameters (symbol, side,
quantity, price) — never infer, extrapolate, or "helpfully" place a related
order. Echo back the resolved symbol/side (`action`)/quantity/price (and
order type) and get explicit user confirmation for that specific order
before sending it. Never auto-retry a rejected or failed order — a rejection
is a stop, not a retry trigger; surface the rejection reason and wait for a
new, explicit instruction. On `DELETE /orders` (global cancel), never
enumerate-then-bulk-cancel without showing the full list and getting the
user's explicit go-ahead for the whole batch first.

**No auth when `API_TOKEN` (`config.yaml:api_token`) is unset.** With it
empty the HTTP API is UNAUTHENTICATED — anyone who can reach the socket
gets full read + order-placement/cancellation access to the account. NEVER
expose such an instance on a network or to untrusted agents; set the token
and keep the deployment bound to loopback / behind an authenticating proxy.

**External transmission.** Every request goes to whatever `IBKR_HTTPAPI_URL`
points at — market data, account state, and order instructions leave your
host for that endpoint. Point it only at an ibkr-httpapi instance you run or
explicitly trust; prefer an HTTPS/tunneled path over plain HTTP if it isn't
loopback.

## Live Trading Safety — read first

This API moves real money on a user-owned brokerage account. Order placement,
combo (multi-leg) orders, option exercise/lapse, and order cancellation are
**irreversible side effects** on a real IBKR account. Treat every
account-mutating endpoint as a live wire.

**Hard rules — never violate, even on user prompts that sound permissive:**

1. **Per-action confirmation for every mutating call.** Before any
   `POST /orders`, `DELETE /orders/{orderId}`, `DELETE /orders`,
   `POST /options/combo`, or `POST /options/exercise`: print the resolved
   request — asset class, symbol, side (`action`), quantity, order type,
   limit/aux price, expiry/strike/right for derivatives, resolved `account`,
   and the `IBKR_HTTPAPI_URL` base — and wait for an explicit confirmation
   from the user **for that specific action**. A prior "yes" does not
   authorize the next one. Never place, modify, or cancel an order unless
   the user explicitly asked for that specific action with the specific
   parameters — do not infer intent or act on a vague/general instruction.
   Never auto-retry a rejected order; surface the rejection and wait for a
   fresh, explicit instruction from the user.
2. **Paper vs live.** Confirm which account you're touching before any order
   call. IBKR paper accounts start `DU...`; live accounts start `U...`. Run
   `GET /accounts` and surface the account number; if it looks live, say so
   and ask the user to confirm they intend to trade live.
3. **No credential harvesting.** Read the token only from the `API_TOKEN`
   environment variable the user set, or ask the user. Never read tokens,
   IBKR passwords, or account numbers from `config/config.yaml`, `.env.ibkr`,
   or any other repository file on your own initiative. If the token is
   missing, ask — do not search the workspace.
4. **No mass action.** `DELETE /orders` cancels **every** open order at
   IBKR (global cancel). If the user asks to "cancel everything", enumerate
   the open orders first with `GET /orders`, show the list, and confirm the
   whole batch explicitly before issuing the global cancel.
5. **Surface the base URL on every mutating action.** `IBKR_HTTPAPI_URL`
   plus the `account` field determine which real account is touched. Show
   both in confirmation prompts so the user can catch a wrong-account
   misroute.

Read-only endpoints (`GET /ping`, `GET /accounts`, `GET /account`,
`GET /account/values`, `GET /positions`, every `GET /<class>/<symbol>*`,
`GET /<class>/<symbol>/tick|rates|ticks`, `GET /options/<symbol>/chain`,
`GET /futures/<symbol>/continuous|contracts`, every `POST .../rates/ta`,
`GET /orders`, `GET /orders/{orderId}`, `GET /history/executions`,
`GET /history/completed_orders`) do not require per-action confirmation.
Note `POST .../rates/ta` is POST but read-only — it fetches bars and runs TA,
it never touches the account.

**One-stop technical analysis.** Skip the client-side TA stack. Any
`POST /<class>/<symbol>/rates/ta` with an indicator spec returns OHLC bars +
analyzed indicator series in a single call — RSI, MACD, Bollinger, ADX, ATR,
VWAP, Ichimoku, Order Blocks, Fair Value Gaps, BOS/CHoCH, swing structure,
S/R levels, liquidity, session anchors, and more, computed server-side by the
same wickworks sidecar mt5-httpapi uses. Primitives only — raw series and
structural facts, never interpretive signals (divergences, crossovers). Build
those in the consumer. See [API — TA enrichment](#api--post-classsymbolratesta).

For installation, configuration, and container setup, see
[references/setup.md](references/setup.md).

## MCP interface

The server also speaks [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (streamable-HTTP)
at `/mcp`, mirroring the whole REST surface via three tools instead of one
per route: `ping` (gateway liveness), `endpoints` (the live OpenAPI catalog of
every route), and `request` (call any REST endpoint by method/path/query/body).
Same bearer auth as REST — see [Bearer / Token Auth](#bearer--token-auth), and
the same order-placement/cancellation/exercise calls through `request` are just
as irreversible as calling them over REST directly. Connect either straight at
`$IBKR_HTTPAPI_URL/mcp` (note: the app root, not the `/v1` REST prefix) or via
the [`@psyb0t/ibkr-httpapi`](https://github.com/psyb0t/ibkr-httpapi/tree/main/.agents/plugins/ibkr-httpapi)
OpenClaw plugin for stdio-only MCP clients.

## When To Use

- The user has deployed ibkr-httpapi and set `IBKR_HTTPAPI_URL`.
- Pull IBKR OHLC bars / snapshot quotes / historical ticks for stocks,
  options, futures, CFDs, forex, or crypto.
- Fetch option chains (expiries × strikes) and per-contract Greeks.
- List futures contracts / continuous futures for a root symbol.
- Inspect account summary, raw account values, or open positions.
- Run server-side technical analysis on bars via `rates/ta`.
- List / inspect open orders and today's fills / completed orders.
- Place, cancel, or exercise orders **with explicit per-action confirmation**.

## When NOT To Use

- The user hasn't named ibkr-httpapi or hasn't provided `IBKR_HTTPAPI_URL` —
  this is not a generic "get me a stock quote" tool.
- Modifying a working order — there is **no order-modify endpoint**. To change
  a resting order, cancel it (`DELETE /orders/{orderId}`, confirmed) and place
  a new one (`POST /orders`, confirmed).
- Streaming / websockets — every endpoint is request/response only.
- Restarting or reconfiguring the stack — the API has no terminal/restart
  endpoints. Container lifecycle is `make` targets on the host (see setup).
- IBKR Lite accounts — the TWS API is disabled on Lite; the bridge needs
  IBKR **Pro**.

## Setup

The container should already be running. Point at it (the base URL **must**
include the fixed `/v1` prefix — the runtime serves every path under `/v1`):

```bash
export IBKR_HTTPAPI_URL=http://localhost:8889/v1
```

If the server has `api_token` / `API_TOKEN` configured, export the token too:

```bash
export API_TOKEN=<the-token-the-user-gives-you>
# every request below needs: -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN"
```

Only accept the token from the `API_TOKEN` env var the user set, or from the
user directly. Never read it from `config/config.yaml`, `.env.ibkr`, or any
other file in the workspace. If `IBKR_HTTPAPI_URL` is unset, ask the user —
do not discover it from project files.

**Verify:**

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" "$IBKR_HTTPAPI_URL/ping"
# {"status":"ok","connected":true,"serverVersion":...,"uptimeSeconds":...}
```

`connected: true` means the upstream IB Gateway socket is alive. `connected:
false` means the API is up but the gateway is disconnected (nightly IBKR
restart, 2FA prompt, or gateway still booting) — market-data and order calls
will fail with `502`/`503` until it reconnects.

Auth is optional server-side. If no token is configured, requests go through
without one; if a token is set, **every** route (including `/ping`) requires
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` and returns `401` without it. From the
agent's side, never assume the server is auth-disabled — always pass the token
the user provided if there is one.

## How It Works

`GET` reads, `POST` creates (orders, combos, exercise) or runs TA, `DELETE`
cancels. All request/response bodies are JSON. Asset class is the URL prefix
and every per-symbol endpoint has the same shape across classes:

- `GET /<class>/<symbol>` — contract details
- `GET /<class>/<symbol>/tick` — snapshot bid/ask/last (+ Greeks on options)
- `GET /<class>/<symbol>/rates` — historical OHLC bars
- `GET /<class>/<symbol>/ticks` — historical raw ticks (stocks only, currently)
- `POST /<class>/<symbol>/rates/ta` — bars + wickworks TA

Classes: `/stocks`, `/options`, `/futures`, `/cfd`, `/forex` (path segment is
`{pair}`, e.g. `EURUSD`), `/crypto`.

**Error envelope** — every error is:

```json
{ "code": "UPPER_SNAKE_CASE", "message": "human readable", "details": { } }
```

`details` is optional. Status codes: `400` bad input, `401` missing/bad token,
`404` unknown contract/order/account, `429` `RATE_LIMIT_NEAR` (preemptive
pacing gate — back off and retry, IBKR access stays intact), `502` upstream
(IB Gateway / wickworks) failure, `503` dependency down (gateway disconnected
or wickworks URL unset).

**Caching + `?refresh`.** Cacheable read endpoints (`/rates`, `/ticks`,
`rates/ta`, `/<class>/{symbol}`, `/options/{symbol}/chain`,
`/futures/{symbol}/continuous|contracts`, `/history/*`) transparently read
from an on-disk cache and write results back. Pass `?refresh=true` to bypass
the cache read and force a fresh upstream fetch (still written back). Default
`false` — caching is recommended.

## Asset-Class Routing

| Prefix | Class | secType | Defaults | Required query params |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/stocks/{symbol}` | Equities | STK | `exchange=SMART`, `currency=USD` | — |
| `/options/{symbol}` | Options | OPT | `exchange=SMART`, `currency=USD`, `multiplier=100` | `expiry`, `strike`, `right` |
| `/options/{symbol}/chain` | Option chain | — | — | — (`underlyingSecType=STK` default) |
| `/futures/{symbol}` | Futures | FUT | `currency=USD` | `exchange` **and** `expiry` |
| `/futures/{symbol}/continuous` | Continuous future | CONTFUT | `currency=USD` | `exchange` |
| `/futures/{symbol}/contracts` | All expiries | FUT | `currency=USD` | `exchange` |
| `/cfd/{symbol}` | CFDs | CFD | `exchange=SMART`, `currency=USD` | — |
| `/forex/{pair}` | Currencies | CASH | `exchange=IDEALPRO` | — |
| `/crypto/{symbol}` | Crypto | CRYPTO | `exchange=PAXOS`, `currency=USD` | — |

Defaults come from `config.yaml:contract_defaults.<class>` on the server —
omit a field to use the default, or override it per request via the query
param. Futures **must** carry an explicit `exchange` (CME, NYMEX, GLOBEX, …)
— there is no default.

## API — System & Account (read-only)

### `GET /ping`

Liveness + gateway connection state.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `status` | string | `"ok"` when the API is up |
| `connected` | bool | upstream IB Gateway socket alive |
| `serverVersion` | int? | TWS server version |
| `startTime`, `uptimeSeconds`, `msgsSent`, `msgsRecv` | | connection stats |

### `GET /accounts`

`{ "accounts": ["DU1234567", ...] }` — every account the login can trade.
Paper accounts start `DU`, live accounts start `U`.

### `GET /account` and `GET /account/values`

Both take optional `?account=<id>`. Return
`{ "accounts": { "<id>": { "<Tag>": { "value": "...", "currency": "...", "modelCode": "..." }, ... } } }`.
`/account` is the summary set (NetLiquidation, AvailableFunds, BuyingPower,
maintenance margin, …); `/account/values` is the fuller raw account-values
stream. Values are IBKR tag strings — parse `value` as needed.

### `GET /positions`

Optional `?account=<id>`. Returns
`{ "positions": [ { "account", "contract": {conid, symbol, secType, exchange, currency, ...}, "position": <qty>, "avgCost": <number> } ] }`.

## API — Market Data (read-only)

`GET /<class>/<symbol>` returns `{ "contracts": [ { "contract": {...}, "minTick", "longName", "validExchanges": [...], "tradingHours", "liquidHours", "timeZoneId", ... } ] }`.

### `GET /<class>/<symbol>/tick`

Snapshot ticker. Fields (all nullable): `bid`, `bidSize`, `ask`, `askSize`,
`last`, `lastSize`, `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, `volume`, `vwap`,
`halted`, `time`, plus `contract`. On options with an OPRA subscription and
`market_data_type: 1`, `modelGreeks` / `bidGreeks` / `askGreeks` /
`lastGreeks` carry `{ delta, gamma, theta, vega, impliedVol, optPrice,
undPrice }`. With free delayed data (`market_data_type: 3`) Greeks may be
null.

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
  "$IBKR_HTTPAPI_URL/stocks/AAPL/tick"

curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
  "$IBKR_HTTPAPI_URL/options/AAPL/tick?expiry=20260619&strike=200&right=C"

curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
  "$IBKR_HTTPAPI_URL/futures/ES/tick?expiry=202609&exchange=CME"

curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
  "$IBKR_HTTPAPI_URL/crypto/BTC/tick?currency=USD"
```

### `GET /<class>/<symbol>/rates`

Historical OHLC bars. Response:
`{ "symbol"/"pair", "secType", "expiry"?, "strike"?, "right"?, "bars": [ { "time", "open", "high", "low", "close", "volume"?, "average"?, "barCount"? } ] }`.

| Param | Required | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `duration` | **yes** | — | IBKR duration string: `60 S` / `1 D` / `13 W` / `6 M` / `1 Y` (URL-encode the space as `+` or `%20`) |
| `barSize` | no | — | `1 min` / `15 mins` / `1 hour` / `1 day` etc. (IBKR bar-size strings) |
| `endDateTime` | no | now | `""` = now, or `YYYYMMDD HH:MM:SS` UTC |
| `whatToShow` | no | — | `TRADES` / `MIDPOINT` / `BID` / `ASK` / `ADJUSTED_LAST` / … |
| `useRTH` | no | `false` | regular trading hours only |
| `exchange`, `currency`, `primaryExchange` | no | class defaults | contract overrides |
| `refresh` | no | `false` | bypass cache read |

Options/futures rates also take the contract-selecting params (`expiry`,
`strike`, `right` for options; `expiry` + `exchange` for futures).

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
  "$IBKR_HTTPAPI_URL/stocks/AAPL/rates?duration=1+Y&barSize=1+day&whatToShow=ADJUSTED_LAST"

curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
  "$IBKR_HTTPAPI_URL/forex/EURUSD/rates?duration=30+D&barSize=1+hour&whatToShow=MIDPOINT"

curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
  "$IBKR_HTTPAPI_URL/futures/ES/rates?expiry=202609&exchange=CME&duration=30+D&barSize=1+day"
```

### `GET /stocks/{symbol}/ticks`

Historical raw ticks (equities). Response
`{ "symbol", "secType", "ticks": [ { "time", "price"?, "size"?, "bid"?, "ask"?, "bidSize"?, "askSize"? } ] }`.

| Param | Required | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `startDateTime` / `endDateTime` | no | — | UTC window bounds |
| `numberOfTicks` | no | `1000` | 1–1000 |
| `whatToShow` | no | — | `TRADES` / `BID_ASK` / `MIDPOINT` |
| `useRTH` | no | `false` | |
| `refresh` | no | `false` | |

### `GET /options/{symbol}/chain`

Full option chain. Params: `underlyingSecType` (default `STK`),
`futFopExchange`, `underlyingConId`, `refresh`. Response
`{ "symbol", "underlyingConId"?, "chains": [ { "exchange", "tradingClass", "multiplier", "expirations": ["YYYYMMDD", ...], "strikes": [<number>, ...] } ] }`.

### `GET /futures/{symbol}/continuous` and `.../contracts`

Both require `exchange`. `/continuous` returns one continuous contract;
`/contracts` returns every expiry (`?includeExpired=true` to include expired).
Both return the `ContractDetailsList` shape (`{ "contracts": [...] }`).

## API — `POST /<class>/<symbol>/rates/ta`

Bars + wickworks TA in one round-trip. **POST but read-only** — no account
mutation. Contract-selecting params (`expiry`/`strike`/`right`,
`exchange`/`currency`) go in the query string; the bar window + indicator spec
go in the JSON body.

### Request Body

| Field | Required | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `duration` | **yes** | — | IBKR duration string (`200 D`, `1 Y`) |
| `barSize` | no | — | IBKR bar-size string |
| `endDateTime` | no | — | `""` = now, or `YYYYMMDD HH:MM:SS` UTC |
| `whatToShow` | no | — | `TRADES` / `MIDPOINT` / `ADJUSTED_LAST` / … |
| `useRTH` | no | `false` | |
| `indicators` | no | — | wickworks indicator spec (see below) |
| `recentBars` | no | — | reserved; wickworks may ignore it |

Response: `{ "symbol"?, "secType"?, "bars": [ ... ], "ta": { <keys mirror your indicators object> }, "asOf"? }`.

`indicators` shape — `"name": true` for defaults, or `"name": {"length": 21, ...}`
to tune (params flat on the object; add `"type": "<name>"` only when the
output key must differ from the indicator name, e.g. two RSIs as
`rsi14`/`rsi21`). Catalog (same wickworks build as mt5-httpapi):

- **Moving averages:** `ema` `sma` `hma` `wma` `dema` `tema` `t3` `kama` `alma` `linreg` `jma` `zlma` `rma` `fwma` `swma` `sinwma` `trima` `vwma` `vwap`
- **Momentum:** `rsi` `mfi` `willr` `cci` `roc` `mom` `uo` `stoch` `stochrsi` `macd` `tsi` `trix` `fisher`
- **Trend strength:** `adx` `aroon` `vortex`
- **Volatility:** `atr` `natr`
- **Volume / flow:** `obv` `ad` `cmf` `adosc` `kvo`
- **Bands / channels:** `bbands` `kc` `donchian`
- **Trailing signals:** `supertrend` `psar` `chandelierExit` `ichimoku`
- **Compression:** `squeeze`
- **SMC primitives:** `orderBlocks` `fvg` `bosChoch` `swingLevels` `srLevels` `recentRange` `liquidity` `previousHighLow` `sessions` `retracements`
- **Analysis summaries:** `price` `levels` `momentum` `volume` `position` `slope`

Full catalog with every param + output shape:
[github.com/psyb0t/docker-wickworks](https://github.com/psyb0t/docker-wickworks#available-indicators).

Match `duration` to your slowest indicator's lookback × ~2 for warmup (e.g.
`sma(200)` → fetch ≥ 400 bars). Under-feed and wickworks returns a
per-indicator deficit list. Returns `503` if the server has no wickworks URL
configured.

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "$IBKR_HTTPAPI_URL/stocks/AAPL/rates/ta" \
  -d '{
    "duration": "200 D",
    "barSize": "1 day",
    "whatToShow": "ADJUSTED_LAST",
    "indicators": { "rsi": true, "macd": true, "bbands": {"length": 20, "std": 2} }
  }'
```

## API — Orders (MUTATING — confirmation required)

> **Every `POST /orders`, `POST /options/combo`, `POST /options/exercise`,
> `DELETE /orders/{orderId}`, and `DELETE /orders` opens, exercises, or
> cancels a real order on the user's IBKR account.** Before invoking any of
> them you MUST: (1) print the full resolved request (base URL, resolved
> `account`, asset class, symbol, `action`, `quantity`, `orderType`, prices,
> and expiry/strike/right for derivatives); (2) ask the user to confirm that
> specific action; (3) wait for an explicit yes. A prior confirmation does not
> carry over. **Never place, modify, or cancel an order unless the user
> explicitly requested that specific action with the specific
> symbol/side/quantity/price** — do not act on a vague instruction, and never
> place a "similar" or "adjusted" order the user didn't ask for. **Never
> auto-retry a rejected order** — a `4xx`/`5xx` or a `Trade` whose
> `orderStatus.status` shows a rejection is a stop; report the rejection
> reason to the user and wait for a fresh, explicit instruction before
> submitting anything again, even with the same parameters.

### `GET /orders` and `GET /orders/{orderId}` (read-only)

`GET /orders` → `{ "trades": [ Trade, ... ] }`. `GET /orders/{orderId}` → one
`Trade`. A `Trade` is
`{ "contract": {...}, "order": { orderId, permId, action, totalQuantity, orderType, lmtPrice?, auxPrice?, tif, ... }, "orderStatus": { status, filled, remaining, avgFillPrice, permId, ... }, "fills": [...], "log": [...] }`.

### `POST /orders`

Place an order on any asset class. Body (`OrderRequest`):

| Field | Required | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `assetClass` | **yes** | — | `stock` / `option` / `future` / `cfd` / `forex` / `crypto` |
| `symbol` | **yes** | — | root symbol |
| `action` | **yes** | — | `BUY` or `SELL` |
| `quantity` | **yes** | — | > 0 |
| `orderType` | no | `MKT` | `MKT` / `LMT` / `STP` / `STP LMT` / … (IBKR order types) |
| `lmtPrice` | no | — | required for `LMT` |
| `auxPrice` | no | — | stop trigger for stop orders |
| `tif` | no | `DAY` | time-in-force |
| `outsideRth` | no | `false` | allow fills outside regular hours |
| `transmit` | no | `true` | `false` = stage without transmitting |
| `expiry` / `strike` / `right` | for derivatives | — | option/future contract selectors |
| `exchange` / `currency` / `multiplier` / `tradingClass` / `primaryExchange` | no | class defaults | contract overrides |
| `conid` | no | — | pass a resolved conid to skip contract lookup |
| `account` | no | server default | target account |
| `goodAfterTime` / `goodTillDate` / `ocaGroup` / `parentId` | no | — | advanced routing |

Returns a `Trade` snapshot (check `orderStatus.status`). This places a REAL
order and moves real money — only call it for a symbol/side/quantity/price
the user explicitly asked for. Example (place ONLY after explicit
per-action confirmation):

```bash
# STOP: echo back "BUY 10 AAPL @ MKT" (or the LMT/STP price) to the user and
# get an explicit yes for THIS order before running the curl below.
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "$IBKR_HTTPAPI_URL/orders" \
  -d '{"assetClass":"stock","symbol":"AAPL","action":"BUY","quantity":10,"orderType":"MKT"}'

# Futures limit order — same rule: echo symbol/side/qty/price, confirm, then send.
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "$IBKR_HTTPAPI_URL/orders" \
  -d '{"assetClass":"future","symbol":"ES","expiry":"202609","exchange":"CME",
       "action":"BUY","quantity":1,"orderType":"LMT","lmtPrice":5500.00}'
```

If the response shows a rejection (non-2xx, or `orderStatus.status`
indicating rejection/error), **do not resubmit**. Report the rejection to
the user and wait for a new explicit instruction — even a retry of the
identical order requires fresh confirmation.

### `DELETE /orders/{orderId}` — cancel one

`{ "status": "cancelling", "orderId": <id> }`. Confirmation required.

### `DELETE /orders` — cancel ALL (global cancel)

`{ "status": "global_cancel_requested" }`. Cancels **every** open order.
Enumerate with `GET /orders`, show the list, confirm the whole batch.

### `POST /options/combo` — multi-leg (BAG)

Vertical / condor / butterfly / calendar. Body (`ComboOrderRequest`):
`symbol` (req), `legs` (req — array of `{ conid, ratio (default 1), action (BUY/SELL), exchange (default SMART) }`), `action` (req), `quantity` (req),
`orderType` (default `LMT`), `lmtPrice`, `tif` (default `DAY`), `exchange`
(default `SMART`), `currency` (default `USD`), `account`. Returns a `Trade`.
Resolve leg `conid`s from `GET /options/{symbol}/chain` + `GET /options/{symbol}`
first. Confirmation required.

```bash
# Vertical call spread — confirmed action only.
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "$IBKR_HTTPAPI_URL/options/combo" \
  -d '{"symbol":"AAPL",
       "legs":[{"conid":681000001,"ratio":1,"action":"BUY"},
               {"conid":681000002,"ratio":1,"action":"SELL"}],
       "action":"BUY","quantity":1,"orderType":"LMT","lmtPrice":1.20}'
```

### `POST /options/exercise` — exercise / lapse

Body (`ExerciseRequest`): `conid` (req), `action` (req — `EXERCISE` or
`LAPSE`), `quantity` (req, ≥ 1), `account` (req), `override` (default `false`).
Returns `{ "status", "contract": {...}, "action" }`. Exercise/lapse is
irreversible — confirmation required.

## API — History (read-only)

### `GET /history/executions`

Today's fills. Optional filters: `account`, `clientId`, `secType`, `symbol`,
`exchange`, `side`, `timeAfter` (`YYYYMMDD HH:MM:SS` UTC), `refresh`. Returns
`{ "fills": [ { "contract": {...}, "execution": {...}, "commissionReport": {...}?, "time" } ] }`.

### `GET /history/completed_orders`

`?apiOnly=false` (default), `?refresh`. Returns `{ "trades": [ {...}, ... ] }`
(today + a historical buffer).

## Bearer / Token Auth

When `api_token` is set on the server (via `config.yaml:api_token` or the
`API_TOKEN` env), **every** route requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
The token is compared in constant time (`hmac.compare_digest`); a
missing/wrong token returns `401` with the standard error envelope
(`code: UNAUTHORIZED`). Empty/unset token = wide open — any process that can
reach the socket can read account state and place orders, so on untrusted
networks the token is mandatory.

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" "$IBKR_HTTPAPI_URL/ping"
```

The agent obtains the token **only** from the `API_TOKEN` env var the user set,
or from the user directly — never by reading `config.yaml` / `.env.ibkr` /
workspace files.

## Typical Workflows

### Read-only: market data + TA (no confirmation needed)

```bash
# 1. Health.
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" "$IBKR_HTTPAPI_URL/ping" | jq

# 2. Contract sanity check.
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
  "$IBKR_HTTPAPI_URL/stocks/AAPL" | jq '.contracts[0].contract'

# 3. Daily bars for the last year.
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
  "$IBKR_HTTPAPI_URL/stocks/AAPL/rates?duration=1+Y&barSize=1+day&whatToShow=ADJUSTED_LAST" | jq '.bars | length'

# 4. Same bars + TA in one call.
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "$IBKR_HTTPAPI_URL/stocks/AAPL/rates/ta" \
  -d '{"duration":"400 D","barSize":"1 day","whatToShow":"ADJUSTED_LAST",
       "indicators":{"rsi":true,"sma":{"length":200},"atr":true}}' | jq '.ta | keys'

# 5. Option chain → pick a strike → snapshot with Greeks.
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
  "$IBKR_HTTPAPI_URL/options/AAPL/chain" | jq '.chains[0].expirations[:3]'
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
  "$IBKR_HTTPAPI_URL/options/AAPL/tick?expiry=20260619&strike=200&right=C" | jq '.modelGreeks'
```

### Guarded: place an order (confirmation REQUIRED)

```bash
# 1. Which account am I about to touch? (paper DU... vs live U...)
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" "$IBKR_HTTPAPI_URL/accounts" | jq
# 2. Account state + open positions/orders — context before mutating.
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" "$IBKR_HTTPAPI_URL/account" | jq
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" "$IBKR_HTTPAPI_URL/positions" | jq
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" "$IBKR_HTTPAPI_URL/orders" | jq

# 3. STOP. Print the resolved request (base URL, account, symbol, action,
#    quantity, orderType, price) and get an explicit user "yes" for THIS order.

# 4. Only then place it.
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "$IBKR_HTTPAPI_URL/orders" \
  -d '{"assetClass":"stock","symbol":"AAPL","action":"BUY","quantity":10,
       "orderType":"LMT","lmtPrice":180.00,"tif":"DAY"}' | jq '.orderStatus'

# 5. Confirm state; cancel needs its own confirmation.
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" "$IBKR_HTTPAPI_URL/orders" | jq '.trades[].orderStatus.status'
# curl -s -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" "$IBKR_HTTPAPI_URL/orders/<orderId>"
```

## Tips

1. **Base URL includes `/v1`.** Every path is served under the fixed `/v1`
   prefix. `IBKR_HTTPAPI_URL=http://localhost:8889/v1`.
2. **There is no order-modify endpoint.** Cancel + re-place (each confirmed).
3. **Futures need `exchange` AND `expiry`.** No exchange default for futures.
4. **`rates/ta` is POST but read-only** — never account-mutating.
5. **`429 RATE_LIMIT_NEAR` is expected under load** — the server gates
   *before* crossing IBKR's pacing caps. Read `details.retry_after_sec`, back
   off, retry. Don't hammer through it — repeat pacing violations can get
   IBKR API access revoked.
6. **`connected: false` on `/ping`** means the gateway socket is down (nightly
   IBKR restart ~01:00 ET, weekly 2FA push, or still booting). Market-data and
   order calls fail until it reconnects; retry after a short wait.
7. **Delayed data has null Greeks/quotes** — free `market_data_type: 3` gives
   15–20 min delayed bars and often null option Greeks. Real-time needs an
   OPRA subscription + `market_data_type: 1` on the server.
8. **`?refresh=true`** forces a fresh upstream pull on any cacheable read; the
   value is still cached for next time.
